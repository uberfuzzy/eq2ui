These are mods that are inactive (not loaded by game).

I have used them at some point in the past, but have chosen to stop for one reason or another.

Common reason: they broke due to UI updates, and I was too lazy/busy to fix at the time.

Less common: It was found that SOE had improved the default UI to a sufficient point that rendered the mod useless (but retained because it may have had good examples of how to do/access things)
