These are the UI modifications I use for EverQuest II (EQ2).

## purpose
This repo serves a few purposes:

1. To provide some sort of coherent offsite backup in one place (dropbox is nice, but limited for version control)
2. To put all the stuff I use online for others to pull (without needing to setup a new "mod" entry on EQ2interface)
  * Many of these are already up there, though may be farther behind then what I use.
3. A proof of concept test on an article I'm working on, regarding moving MMO UI mods to a version control system, so that updates (both detection and downloading) could be more automated (think somewhere between Wordpress and Mediawiki)
4. To provide version control (esp branch switching) for future development work.
	
I'll do my best to setup some sort "stable" or "production" branch, and these would be what I consider publishable (what I would zip and upload to EQ2UI) or usable for the public (sometimes I leave tracer buttons/fields/labels in my mods for a long time, since they dont bother me, but would not give that version to someone to use)

## Ownership
Some of these I made from scratch (well, from the game's base).

Some of these are from EQ2interface.com (some modified further, some used straight up), I make no claim to own them, and make no warranty on their copy here. I'll do my best to label these, and link to the EQ2interface entry for them.
